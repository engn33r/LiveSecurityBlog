I'm a security researcher who enjoys distilling useful pieces of information I find with the hope that others, or perhaps even my future self, will find this information useful. You can also find me at [@bl4ckb1rd71](https://twitter.com/bl4ckb1rd71).

If you see anything on this blog that needs updating or fixing, don't hesitate to reach out. My updated contact info is at [https://erikelbieh.com/contact](https://erikelbieh.com/contact).

You can even reach out even if you don't have any updates or fixes to suggest!
