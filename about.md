Thanks for stopping by my security blog!

As a security researcher who enjoy learning about new technologies, I try to distill useful pieces of information I find with the hope that others, or perhaps even my future self, will find this information useful. If you see anything on this blog that needs updating or fixing, don't hesitate to reach out. My updated contact info is at [https://erikelbieh.com/contact](https://erikelbieh.com/contact)

You can even reach out if you don't have any updates or fixes to suggest!
